# Stripe Payment Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect Payment Flow**
- **Problem**: PlaceOrderScreen was creating orders before payment, causing double order creation
- **Fix**: Modified flow to create payment intent first, then create order after successful payment

### 2. **Backend Route Issues**
- **Problem**: Stripe route expected existing order ID but flow was creating payment intent before order
- **Fix**: Updated `/create-payment-intent` to accept order data and amount directly
- **Added**: New `/confirm-payment` route to create order after successful payment

### 3. **Payment Processing Logic**
- **Problem**: PaymentProcessingScreen wasn't properly handling order creation after payment
- **Fix**: Updated to use new confirm-payment endpoint with proper error handling

### 4. **Form Validation**
- **Problem**: Shipping form lacked proper validation
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive validation for all required fields

### 5. **Server Configuration**
- **Problem**: Duplicate Stripe webhook middleware
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate middleware configuration

## Updated Flow

### For Stripe Payments:
1. **Shipping Screen**: Collect and validate shipping address
2. **Payment Method Screen**: Select Stripe as payment method
3. **Place Order Screen**: Create payment intent (not order)
4. **Payment Processing Screen**: Handle Stripe payment
5. **After Successful Payment**: Create order via confirm-payment endpoint
6. **Redirect**: Navigate to order confirmation page

### For PayPal Payments:
1. **Shipping Screen**: Collect shipping address
2. **Payment Method Screen**: Select PayPal
3. **Place Order Screen**: Create order directly (existing flow)
4. **Order Screen**: Handle PayPal payment

## Key Changes Made

- `PlaceOrderScreen.jsx`: Fixed payment flow logic

- `ShippingScreen.jsx`: Added form validation
